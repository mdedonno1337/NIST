Python NIST library
###################

Welcome to the documentation of the python NIST library. The aim of the python library is to open, modify and write Biometric Information files based on the standard proposed by the NIST (for short: NIST format) [NIST2013]_.

This python library contains a main module to read and write NIST files (named 'NIST.traditional'), and a second module to work with fingerprint related NIST files (named 'NIST.fingerprint'). Some complementary modules are provided for some particular cases.

The developpement and maintainance have been made by Marco De Donno, School of Criminal Justice, Faculty of Law, Criminal Justice and Public Administration, University of Lausanne, Switzerland. This library is not related to the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
